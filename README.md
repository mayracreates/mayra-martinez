I am a motivated data analyst with a background in property management. Triple Ten is teaching me all of the hard skills needed to become a Business Intelligence Analyst which also includes projects and assessments. The hard skills that I learned were SQL, Tableau and Power BI. I am very interested in perfecting this craft and am open to doing projects to showcase the skills that I have learned. I was born and raised in New York City and I have been vegan for 9 years. If you wish to connect with me, please follow me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/miss-mayra-martinez/
